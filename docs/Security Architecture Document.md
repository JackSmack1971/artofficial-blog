## 1. Security Vision & Objectives

The security architecture is built on a foundation of **proactive threat mitigation**, **data privacy by design**, and **layered defense**. Our vision is to establish and maintain a highly secure and trusted platform that protects subscriber data, ensures content integrity, and guarantees high availability.

### **Key Security Objectives:**
* **Confidentiality**: Protect subscriber personal data from unauthorized access, both internally and externally.
* **Integrity**: Ensure that content and user data cannot be altered or corrupted by unauthorized parties.
* **Availability**: Maintain 99.9% uptime and protect against service disruptions like DDoS attacks, as required by NFR011.
* **Compliance**: Adhere strictly to GDPR and other data protection regulations, building user trust and mitigating legal risks.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

Access to system resources will be strictly controlled through a role-based framework that enforces the principle of least privilege.

### **Authentication Framework**
* **Content & Admin Staff (Administrators, Editors, Authors)**: Authentication for all back-office users will be managed through the **Ghost Pro platform's built-in authentication system**. To enhance security, **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) will be mandatory** for all user roles with content creation or administrative privileges.
* **API Authentication**: Secure access to the Ghost Admin API will be handled via **short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)**. These tokens will have a 5-minute expiry to limit the window of opportunity in case of a token compromise and will be signed using the secret key from the Ghost Admin API configuration.

### **Authorization Framework (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC)**
User permissions are defined by roles, ensuring users can only perform actions necessary for their function.

* **User Roles**:
    * **Administrator**: Full control over system settings, user management, and content.
    * **Editor**: Can create, edit, and publish content from all authors.
    * **Author**: Can create and edit their own content but cannot publish directly without review.
    * **Guest Author (Contributor)**: A temporary role with privileges limited to creating draft posts.
* **Implementation**: Authorization is enforced at the Ghost Pro CMS level and will be validated in any custom-built API routes using security middleware that inspects the JWT for role information.

## 3. Data Encryption and Protection

All data, especially sensitive subscriber information, will be protected using industry-standard encryption protocols, both in transit and at rest.

### **Data Encryption Standards**
* **Encryption in Transit**: All data transmission between user browsers, the Vercel-hosted frontend, and third-party APIs (like Ghost Pro) will be encrypted using **TLS 1.3**. This policy is enforced via an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header configured in the `vercel.json` file to prevent downgrade attacks.
* **Encryption at Rest**: All platform data, including the content database and subscriber information stored within Ghost Pro's managed MySQL database, will be protected with **AES-256 encryption**. This extends to all automated daily backups managed by the service provider.

### **Subscriber Information Protection**
* **Data Minimization**: In line with GDPR principles, we will only collect the data essential for service delivery, primarily an email address and subscription preferences.
* **Secure Storage**: Subscriber data is stored and managed within the chosen newsletter platform (Ghost Pro or ConvertKit), which is responsible for database-level encryption and security.

## 4. GDPR Compliance Implementation

GDPR compliance is a cornerstone of the platform's security and privacy posture, ensuring users have full control over their personal data.

### **Core GDPR Principles**
* **Lawful Basis for Processing**: All data processing is based on **explicit user consent**, obtained via a clear, double opt-in newsletter signup process.
* **Consent Management**: A cookie consent banner will be implemented to manage consent for analytics trackers. Non-essential scripts, particularly Google Analytics 4, will not execute until explicit consent is granted.
* **Data Subject Rights**: We will provide functionality for users to exercise their GDPR rights, as detailed in the technical and functional requirements.
    * **Right to Access**: Users can request an export of their data via a dedicated API endpoint. The `DataProtectionService` will retrieve all personal data from the newsletter platform and provide it to the user in a structured JSON format.
    * **Right to Erasure**: Users can request the deletion of their personal data. This process will trigger the `deleteUserData` function to permanently remove their record from the newsletter service and anonymize any associated analytics data. This request must be fulfilled within 30 days.

## 5. API Security and Rate Limiting

Internal and external APIs will be secured to prevent abuse, data leakage, and denial-of-service attacks.

### **API Security Protocols**
* **Input Validation**: All API routes, especially the public-facing newsletter subscription endpoint, will perform rigorous server-side validation of all incoming data to prevent malicious payloads.
* **CORS Policy**: A strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be enforced via middleware to ensure that API requests are only accepted from the `artofficialintelligence.academy` domain.
* **Security Headers**: The application will utilize security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, and a stringent `Content-Security-Policy` to mitigate risks like clickjacking and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### **Rate Limiting**
To protect against brute-force attacks and ensure high availability, application-level rate limiting will be implemented on sensitive endpoints.
* **Implementation**: Using a Redis-backed middleware, we will limit requests to endpoints like `/api/newsletter/subscribe` to **10 requests per minute per IP address**.
* **Response**: Any IP address exceeding this limit will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP error response.

## 6. Incident Response Procedures

A structured incident response plan ensures a swift and effective reaction to security events, minimizing potential impact. This plan is based on the `IncidentResponseManager` framework outlined in the TAD.

### **Phases of Response**
1.  **Detection and Analysis**:
    * **Triggers**: Incidents are identified through automated alerts from **Sentry** (application errors), **Vercel** (DDoS alerts, performance degradation), or manual user reports.
    * **Assessment**: The on-call developer will immediately analyze the alert to validate the incident, assess its scope, and classify its severity.

2.  **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**:
    * **Containment**: The immediate priority is to isolate the affected system. This could involve revoking a compromised API key, rolling back a deployment on Vercel, or activating Vercel's Attack Challenge Mode.
    * **Eradication**: Once contained, the root cause is addressed. This may involve patching a vulnerable dependency, fixing flawed code, or refining a security rule.
    * **Recovery**: The final step is to restore the service to its fully operational state. This may include deploying the fix or, in a worst-case scenario, restoring data from a secure, verified backup.

3.  **Post-Incident Activity**:
    * **Communication**: In the event of a confirmed data breach involving personal data, we will notify the relevant data protection authorities and all affected subscribers **within 72 hours** of discovery, as mandated by GDPR.
    * **Post-Mortem**: A blameless post-mortem analysis will be conducted to document the incident timeline, root cause, and lessons learned. This will generate actionable steps to improve the security posture and prevent recurrence.
