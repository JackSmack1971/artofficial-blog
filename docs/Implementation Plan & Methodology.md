## **ARTOfficial Intelligence Academy: Implementation Plan & Methodology**

This document outlines the development methodology, project timeline, resource allocation, and quality assurance processes for the ARTOfficial Intelligence Academy platform. The plan is designed to meet the business objectives detailed in the provided project documentation, ensuring a high-quality, scalable, and timely launch.

### **Development Methodology: Agile/Scrum Framework**

An Agile/Scrum methodology will be adopted for this project. This approach is ideally suited to the project's "lean startup model" and the dynamic nature of the AI market, allowing for rapid iteration, continuous feedback, and flexible adaptation to new requirements.

  * **Sprint Structure:** The project will be organized into **two-week sprints**. This cadence allows for rapid delivery of functional components and frequent review cycles.
  * **Scrum Ceremonies:** The team will adhere to standard Scrum ceremonies:
      * **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each sprint to define the scope and backlog.
      * **Daily Stand-ups:** Brief daily meetings to sync progress and address blockers.
      * **Sprint Review:** A demonstration of the completed work to stakeholders at the end of each sprint.
      * **Sprint Retrospective:** An internal team meeting to reflect on the process and identify improvements.
  * **Backlog Management:** The Product Owner will maintain the product backlog, prioritizing features based on business value, user feedback, and strategic goals outlined in the PRD.

### **Resource Allocation and Team Responsibilities**

The project will be executed by a lean, cross-functional team as defined in the BRD and PRD. In the Scrum framework, these roles will be defined as follows:

  * **Product Owner: Content Director (1.0 FTE)**

      * **Responsibilities:** Owns the product vision and strategy. Manages and prioritizes the product backlog. Represents stakeholder interests and is responsible for the overall success of the product. Approves work during Sprint Reviews.

  * **Scrum Master: Developer (0.5 FTE)**

      * **Responsibilities:** Facilitates Scrum ceremonies, removes impediments for the development team, and ensures the Agile process is followed. Also acts as the primary technical implementer.

  * **Development Team:**

      * **Developer (0.5 FTE):** Responsible for all technical implementation, from frontend development in Next.js to backend integrations with Ghost Pro and Vercel deployment.
      * **Technical Writer/Editor (0.75 FTE):** Responsible for creating the core "product"â€”the content. Works within sprints to research, write, and edit articles according to the content calendar.
      * **Social Media Manager (0.25 FTE, contract):** Engages with the community and promotes content, providing crucial feedback for the backlog.
      * **Guest Authors (contract):** Integrated into the content workflow to provide specialized articles and scale content velocity.

### **Code Review and Quality Assurance Process**

A multi-layered QA process will be implemented to ensure the platform meets the non-functional requirements for performance, security, and reliability.

  * **Development Workflow:**

      * **Version Control:** A Git-based workflow will be used.
      * **Preview Deployments:** All pull requests will trigger an automatic preview deployment on Vercel, allowing for review before merging.

  * **Code Review:**

      * Peer reviews are mandatory for all code merged into the main branch. Given the 0.5 FTE for the developer, automated static analysis and linting tools will be heavily utilized to maintain code quality.

  * **Testing Strategy:**

    1.  **Automated Testing:** A continuous integration (CI) pipeline will run on every commit, including:
          * **Unit & Integration Tests:** (`npm run test`) to validate individual components and services.
          * **Performance Audits:** (`npm run lighthouse`) to prevent performance regressions.
    2.  **Manual Testing:**
          * **Developer Testing:** The developer will test functionality on local and preview environments.
          * **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** The Product Owner (Content Director) will conduct UAT on preview deployments to ensure features meet business requirements. This includes cross-browser and mobile device testing.
    3.  **Performance & Security:**
          * **Load Testing:** Will be conducted before major feature releases to ensure the system can handle the target of 100,000 monthly users.
          * **Security Audits:** Regular vulnerability assessments and compliance checks will be performed to maintain GDPR compliance and data security.
