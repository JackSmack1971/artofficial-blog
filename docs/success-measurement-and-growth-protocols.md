# Success Measurement and Growth Optimization Protocols

Purpose
Define how success is measured, reported, and improved to achieve PRD targets: 25k subscribers, 35%+ open rate, 100k monthly visitors, and performance SLAs. This document operationalizes the Autonomous Validation Protocol and fitness functions in [/docs/architecture-decisions.json](docs/architecture-decisions.json).

1. Success Definitions (12-Month Horizon)
North Star: Newsletter Subscribers
- Target: 25,000 subscribers
- Milestones: 10k by Month 6; on-trajectory check monthly

Secondary KPIs
- Engagement: Open rate ≥ 35%, Click rate ≥ 8%
- Traffic: 100k monthly unique visitors
- Performance: Lighthouse ≥ 95; LCP p95 ≤ 2.0s; CLS ≤ 0.1; TTI/INP p95 ≤ 3.0s
- Authority: 50+ high-authority backlinks

2. Metric Specifications
2.1 Subscriber Growth
- Definitions:
  - total_subscribers: active confirmed subscribers
  - daily_net_adds: new - churn
  - double_opt_in_rate: confirmations / sent
  - goal_eta_days: projected based on ratePerDay
- Sources:
  - Newsletter platform (Ghost Native or ConvertKit)
  - BI event: subscriber_goal_progress via [/src/lib/analytics/bi.ts](src/lib/analytics/bi.ts)

2.2 Engagement Quality
- Definitions:
  - open_rate = unique_opens / delivered
  - click_rate = unique_clicks / delivered
  - cohort_open_rate = open_rate per cohort (segment, acquisition source)
- Sources:
  - Newsletter analytics; BI event: engagement_kpi

2.3 Acquisition & Traffic
- Definitions:
  - monthly_uniques from GA4/Plausible
  - conversion_by_source: newsletter signups / sessions by source
- Sources:
  - GA4, Plausible, BI events signup_start/signup_submit

2.4 Core Web Vitals
- Definitions:
  - LCP p95, CLS p95, INP/TTI p95 field metrics
- Sources:
  - Lighthouse CI (lab), Vercel Analytics (field), Web-Vitals

3. Fitness Functions and Gates
- Lighthouse Performance ≥ 95 per PR (gate)
- Global LCP p95 ≤ 2.0s (weekly check)
- Newsletter open rate ≥ 35% (monthly check)
- Incident triggers when thresholds breached (see Section 5)

4. Measurement Cadence & Reporting
4.1 Daily
- ETL: subscribers, net adds, double opt-in rate, conversion by source
- Compute subscriber_goal_progress and emit bi.subscriberGoalProgress(current, 25000, ratePerDay)

4.2 Weekly
- Cohort open/click analysis; A/B subject-line results
- CWV trend review; Lighthouse regression analysis
- Growth trajectory vs. goal curve; annotate anomalies

4.3 Monthly
- KPI checkpoint against PRD targets
- Strategy review and resource reallocation if off track

5. Optimization Protocols (If-Breach-Then-Act)
5.1 Engagement (Open Rate)
- Condition: rolling_avg_open_rate over last 2 sends < 32%
- Actions:
  - Deliverability audit: SPF/DKIM/DMARC, list hygiene
  - Subject line A/B (≥ 2 variants, ≥ 5k recipients/variant)
  - Send-time optimization per top cohorts
  - Win-back drip for 90d+ inactive
- Exit Criteria: open_rate ≥ 35% for 2 consecutive sends

5.2 Conversion (Signup)
- Condition: landing conversion < 2.0% over 7d
- Actions:
  - Launch landing page A/B (headline, CTA, social proof)
  - Enable exit-intent modal on target routes
  - Promote inline forms in top posts
- Exit Criteria: conversion ≥ 2.0% within 14d

5.3 Performance (CWV)
- Condition: LCP p95 > 2.0s over 24h or Lighthouse < 95 in PR
- Actions:
  - Image optimization audit; use modern formats; reduce hero payload
  - Verify cache policy from ADR-004 (ISR, s-maxage, SWR)
  - Defer non-critical JS via dynamic imports
- Exit Criteria: Lighthouse ≥ 95 and LCP p95 ≤ 2.0s

5.4 Growth Trajectory (North Star)
- Condition: 7-day moving avg net adds below target curve for 2 weeks
- Actions:
  - Publish cadence micro-boost + partner promo slots
  - Introduce lead magnet CTA in top organic posts
- Exit Criteria: back on curve within 2 weeks

6. Data Integrity and Compliance
- Data Quality: outlier detection, de-duplication, timezone normalization
- Privacy: GDPR compliance; double opt-in; export/delete endpoints
- Security: TLS 1.3; security headers; least-privilege access to analytics

7. Dashboards & Views
- Executive: North Star trajectory, ETA to 25k, open rate trend, CWV status
- Growth: channel conversion, cohort performance, A/B results
- Engineering: route-level CWV, cache hit ratio, image weight by template
- Editorial: content-to-signup correlation, reading depth, topic resonance

8. Roles & Ownership
- Editorial Lead: engagement quality and content experiments
- Growth Lead: acquisition tests and partner channels
- Engineering Lead: performance and reliability
- BI Owner: data integrity, ETL, dashboard maintenance

9. Implementation Hooks
- BI Events: use helpers in [/src/lib/analytics/bi.ts](src/lib/analytics/bi.ts), and engagement emitters in [/src/lib/content/engagement.ts](src/lib/content/engagement.ts)
- CI Gates: Lighthouse per PR with threshold 95 per [/lighthouserc.json](lighthouserc.json)
- Schedules: daily/weekly jobs to compute and emit KPI events
